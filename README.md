# rcb-spring-data-jpa-rest-api
This project is originally from Dan Bunker , a pluralsight author. This demonstrates Spring Data JPA Rest API . 
could be used for education how spring wraps up all coding needs and automatically generates the api paths without a single 
line of code. We just need to configure the repositories of the domain model objects.
